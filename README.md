Hi World! This my project for [Angular 8 course](https://softuni.bg/trainings/2760/angular-january-2020) @ [softuni.bg](https://softuni.bg/). Since I am out of ideas, I decided to solve one of the problems of retake exams from [JS Applications course](https://softuni.bg/trainings/2449/js-applications-october-2019) ([Here is link to contest](https://judge.softuni.bg/Contests/1975/JS-Applications-Retake-Exam-13-December)) with Angular 8.

# Installation of project

This project uses:

- Angular 8 as front-end framework
- Firebase firestore database to store data online

You will need to download:
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (LTS version)
- [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli)

After that:
1. Clone this repo
2. With your terminal/console app change directory to the 'App' folder of the repo 
3. Run "npm install"
4. Add configuration file:   
You must add firebaseConfig object @ enviroments/enviroment.ts file.
This file contains your firebase web configuration and it should be like this:

```typescript
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  firebaseConfig: {
    apiKey: "YourData",
    authDomain: "YourData",
    databaseURL: "YourData",
    projectId: "YourData",
    storageBucket: "YourData",
    messagingSenderId: "YourData",
    appId: "YourData",
    measurementId: "YourData"
  }
};
```
For more info about this configuration visit [HERE](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup) and [HERE](https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/7015592)


After you ready with configuration:

1. With your terminal/console app change directory to the 'App' folder of the repo 
2. Type "ng s" and hit "Enter"
After compilation you must see something like this at the console:
``` js
** Angular Live Development Server is listening on localhost:4200, open your browser on http://localhost:4200/ **
i ｢wdm｣: Compiled successfully.
```

Now you can open your browser and open [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) and enjoy the app :)
