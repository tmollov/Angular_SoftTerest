Hi World! This my project for [Angular 8 course](https://softuni.bg/trainings/2760/angular-january-2020) @ [softuni.bg](https://softuni.bg/). Since I am scarce on ideas, I decided to solve one of the problems of retake exams from [JS Applications course](https://softuni.bg/trainings/2449/js-applications-october-2019) ([Here is link to contest](https://judge.softuni.bg/Contests/1975/JS-Applications-Retake-Exam-13-December)) with Angular 8.
